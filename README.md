# 🚗 AI-Powered Drowsiness Detection System  
**Prevent accidents. Save lives. Stay alert with AI!**  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
Drowsy driving is a major safety concern, leading to countless accidents worldwide. Our **AI-driven Drowsiness Detection System** uses **deep learning and computer vision** to monitor driver alertness in real time. This system detects early signs of fatigue and provides timely warnings, ensuring safer roads.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Real-time face detection** with **Mediapipe**  
✅ **Facial landmark analysis** to monitor eye and mouth movement  
✅ **Advanced image preprocessing** (cropping, resizing, augmentation)  
✅ **CNN-based deep learning model** for accurate classification  
✅ **Google Colab compatibility** for easy execution
